This is where we/I will be storing files for the project.

Even if you cant figure out git, you can still download a copy of the project using the controls to download the project as a zip file, but you won't be able to upload changes all on your own


adding procedure:
	<edit FILENAME>
	git add FILENAME
	git commit -m "message"
	git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/PROJECT.git
	git push origin master
change FILENAME, USERNAME, and PROJECT as needed
